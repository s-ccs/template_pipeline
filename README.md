# Template Pipeline

This is the template pipeline we use to analyze EEG datasets in the CCS group.

## Usage
Be aware that submodules are included:

```
git clone git@github.com:s-ccs/template_pipeline.git

git submodule init
```

## Bug Note
Currently (18.01.2023) amica does not work on our server. This is likely due to an issue with the compiled amica file and the recent server update, so we might have to re-compile. For now use Infomax.
